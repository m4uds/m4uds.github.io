Please don’t leave me with nothing…

"Double or Nothing" is a conceptual artwork that consists of a unique pricing strategy for each piece sold. The artwork is advertised for sale online for a set price that is double the cost of the advertisement fee. The proceeds from the sale are then used to fund the advertisement for the next artwork, which is also sold for double the advertisement cost. This cycle continues until an artwork fails to sell, inevitably leaving the artist with nothing. This process critiques the financial pressures that artists face and the need to sell their work in order to sustain their practice, while also examining the role of social media in promoting and selling artwork. The cyclical nature of the artwork's pricing structure reflects the precariousness of an artist's career, where success is never guaranteed and each piece is a gamble. The potential for financial gain through the doubling of the advertisement cost also represents the hope and optimism that keeps artists going despite the financial risks.

Ultimately, "Double or Nothing" aims to spark discussion around the financial realities of being an artist, the role of social media in the art world, and the impact of commercial pressures on the creative process. Through its unique structure, the piece exposes the complex and often fraught relationship between art and commerce, inviting viewers to consider the true value of art beyond its monetary worth.
